Vulkan translation library, is now available.

This release contains improvements that are listed in the release notes below.
The main highlights are:

  - Initial support for HLSL compute shaders.
  - More support for HLSL features and intrinsics.
  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

The source is available from the following location:

What's new in vkd3d 1.6
=======================


*** libvkd3d-shader

- New features for the HLSL source type:
  - Initial support for compute shaders.
  - Improved support for initialisation and assignment of compound objects
    like structures and arrays, including casts and implicit conversions.
  - Support for loads and stores of texture resource unordered-access views.
  - Support for function attributes. In particular, the required "numthreads"
    attribute for compute shader entry points is now supported.
  - Support for the asuint() intrinsic function.
  - Support for the length() intrinsic function.
  - Support for the normalize() intrinsic function.
  - Support for integer division and modulus.
  - Support for taking the absolute value of integers.
  - Support for floating-point modulus.


- New interfaces:
  - The VKD3D_SHADER_DESCRIPTOR_INFO_FLAG_UAV_ATOMICS descriptor info flag is
    used to indicate that atomic operations are used on unordered-access view
    descriptors.


*** libvkd3d-common

- vkd3d debug output is prefixed with "vkd3d:" in order to make it easier to
  distinguish from output produced by applications or other libraries.


*** demos

- The demos now use libvkd3d-shader to compile HLSL shaders at run-time.
